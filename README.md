# Grow Plant

This project is a simple Python program created to help me learn and practice Python programming concepts. It simulates the growth of a plant based on various weather conditions taken from the weather API.

## Getting Started

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the program:
